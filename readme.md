## 🧠 Pedagogical Concept

This infographic is structured to reflect a **Needs-Based Pedagogy (NBP)** model with four lesson phases:

1. **Discover** — Reveal student interests
2. **Connect** — Link needs to Scratch capabilities
3. **Co-Create** — Enable hands-on building
4. **Reinforce** — Encourage reflection and iteration
